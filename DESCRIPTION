Description: Usually a commercial song is composed of many tracks including vocal,
  piano, percussion, guitar, orchestra and sometimes electronic synthesizer. According 
  to the definition of "entropy", a parameter to reflect the degree of chaos, entropy 
  is constantly increasing, and the increasing process is irreversible. For example, mix
  juice with coca, then it is impossible to isolate coca. Based on that, when render many
  tracks into a wav or mp3 file, it is a pretty hard challenge to remove a track, so get 
  ride of the melody is quite a problem especially when you cannot find the midi file online.
  This package refers to the principle of how headphone brand Boss remove the noise by adding
  the polarize reverse wave of sound we want to get rid of, however rightnow we can only deal
  with song that has mono vocal with 0 pan.
